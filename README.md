# Ultramarine Chromebook Keyboard Map

Bash script and systemd service to apply the
[cros-keyboard-map](https://github.com/weirdtreething/cros-keyboard-map) on Ultramarine Linux.
Based off the script from [postmarketOS](https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/blob/master/main/cros-keyboard-map/APKBUILD),
adapted to work with systemd.
